  <!-- Personal note: I initially had trouble adding the ampersand between "arts" and "crafts" for the title.  I had to Google Search: "how to ignore special characters in html" which led to two results discussing "escapes" for special characters, and result two, "Using character escapes in markup and CSS" led me here: https://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-escapes whre I learned that the imbedded code had a ";" after it, and I remembered that another link (http://www.degraeve.com/reference/specialcharacters.php) had already provided me the solution, but I wasn't typing ";" at the end! ############################## TLDR: use special character codes when spececial characters cause syntax error and don't forget a semicolon (or any other characters).-->
